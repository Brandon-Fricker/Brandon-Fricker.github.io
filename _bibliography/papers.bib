abstract = {Abstract While there are many species that are commonly used for the study of mammalian social behavior, there remains a need for lab-suitable organisms that are appropriate for examining sociality specifically in non-reproductive contexts (i.e., social behavior not in the context of mating or parenting). The spiny mouse, Acomys cahirinus, is a cooperatively breeding rodent that lives in large groups and is a species that holds great potential for studying a wide range of social behaviors in reproductive and non-reproductive contexts. Here, we characterize the basic social behaviors in male and female A. cahirinus to obtain a foundation for future study. We tested adult A. cahirinus in social approach, social preference, social interaction, social recognition, and group size preference paradigms. Regardless of sex, novelty, or familiarity, we found that both males and females rapidly approach conspecifics demonstrating high social boldness. Additionally, both sexes are significantly more prosocial than aggressive when freely interacting with conspecifics. However, we observed effects of sex on social preferences, such that males exhibit a preference to affiliate with same-sex conspecifics, whereas females exhibit a preference for affiliating with opposite-sex conspecifics. We discuss how this preference may relate to the cooperative breeding system of spiny mice. Lastly, both sexes show a robust preference for affiliating with large over small groups, indicating they may be an ideal species for the study of mammalian gregariousness. These data lay a basic foundation for future studies that seek to assess complex group dynamics and the mechanisms underlying reproductive and non-reproductive social behaviors in a highly social mammal.},

abstract = {Activity-dependent changes of synapse strength have been extensively characterized at chemical synapses, but the relationship between physiological forms of activity and strength at electrical synapses remains poorly characterized and understood. For mammalian electrical synapses comprising hexamers of connexin36, physiological forms of neuronal activity in coupled pairs have thus far only been linked to long-term depression; activity that results in strengthening of electrical synapses has not yet been identified. Here, we performed dual whole-cell current-clamp recordings in acute slices of P11?P15 Sprague-Dawley rats of electrically coupled neurons of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a central brain area that regulates cortical input from and attention to the sensory surround. Using TTA-A2 to limit bursting, we show that tonic spiking in one neuron of a pair results in long-term potentiation of electrical synapses. We use experiments and computational modeling to show that the magnitude of plasticity expressed alters the functionality of the synapse. Potentiation is expressed asymmetrically, indicating that regulation of connectivity depends on the direction of use. Furthermore, calcium pharmacology and imaging indicate that potentiation depends on calcium flux. We thus propose a calcium-based activity rule for bidirectional plasticity of electrical synapse strength. Because electrical synapses dominate intra-TRN connectivity, these synapses and their activity-dependent modifications are key dynamic regulators of thalamic attention circuitry. More broadly, we speculate that bidirectional modifications of electrical synapses may be a widespread and powerful principle for ongoing, dynamic reorganization of neuronal circuitry across the brain.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This work reveals a physiologically relevant form of activity pairing in coupled neurons that results in long-term potentiation of mammalian electrical synapses. These findings, in combination with previous work, allow the authors to propose a bidirectional calcium-based rule for plasticity of electrical synapses, similar to those demonstrated for chemical synapses. These new insights inform the field on how electrical synapse plasticity may modify the neural circuits that incorporate them.},
