From insects to humans, gregariousness- the preference to interact in large groups- likely drives much of their success. 
Without congregating together into large groups, behaviors like foraging, predator defense, and nest building would be
significantly more challenging. Despite the foundational role gregarious behavior likely plays in many species' survival,
neuroscience has yet to dive deep into its neural underpinnings, and many common model organisms do not readily aggregate
together.

The spiny mouse, <i> Acomys cahirinus </i>, is a cooperatively breeding, large-group living rodent that typically aggregate
in groups of 30-40 individuals in the wild. Initial social behavior characterization of the species revealed that they show
incredibly low levels of aggression and prefer to interact with larger groups over smaller ones (Fricker et al., 2022).

The highly gregarious nature of spiny mice position them as a fantastic model for exploring the neural correlates
of grouping together in large numbers. I am currently employing various ethologically valid behavioral tests with
state-of-the art neural recording and manipulation techniques to pinpoint the circuits driving this behavior. 

At the Kelly lab, I have successfully piloted viral techniques such as DREADDs and fiber photometry as well as 
brain clearing methods like iDISCO+ in the spiny mice, allowing us to broaden our understanding of gregariousness.
