I am a social neuroscientist investigating the neural correlates of complex, non-reproductive social behaviors. I strive to integrate ethologically relevant behaviors with neural recording and manipulation techniques in unsual models. 

<strong> The Neural Circuitry of Cooperation, Intra-group, and Inter-group Interactions </strong>

While most species engage in prosocial or aggressive social behaviors with at least one individual, many engage with and coordinate their behavior across multiple individuals at once. These dynamic social interactions can occur 
within and across groups, making them incredibly versatile and complex. I aim to expand our understanding of the neural properties guiding these behaviors through real-time tracking of multiple behaving indivuals in cunjunction
with neural recording and manipulation techniques. I am particularly interested in doing so in highly social species like spiny mice, honey bees, and bats.
