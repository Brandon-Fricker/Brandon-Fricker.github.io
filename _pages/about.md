I am a social neuroscientist investigating the neural correlates of complex, non-reproductive social behaviors. I strive to integrate ethologically relevant behaviors with neural recording and manipulation techniques in unsual models. 

The foundation of all social behaviors is the willingness to interact- both positively and negatively- with others.
